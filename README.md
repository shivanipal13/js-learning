How to Run JavaScript Code in Node.js

Below are the steps to run a JavaScript file in the Node.js terminal.


To run a JavaScript file in the Node.js terminal, you follow these steps:

Steps:
1.Install Node.js (if not installed):

First, make sure Node.js is installed on your system. You can check this by running:
node -v
If it's not installed, you can download it from the official website: Node.js.
2.Navigate to the directory where your file is located:

Open a terminal or command prompt and use the cd command to navigate to the folder where your .js file is located. For example:

cd path/to/your/folder

If your file is in the 02_basics/03_objects.js directory, make sure you go to the correct folder containing the file.

3.Run the JavaScript file with Node.js:

Once you're in the correct folder, run the file by typing:

node 02_basics/03_objects.js

Note: If you're already in the 02_basics folder, you would just run:

node 03_objects.js


Output:

If your JavaScript code has console.log() statements or any other output, it will display the result in the terminal.
